 *   company.{id}      owners — every branch under their company.
 *   bookings.global   admins — every booking everywhere.
 *
 * Caller picks the most-specific channel for the current user's
 * role (see `resolveBookingChannel` in `GlobalBookingNotifier`).
 *

 * re-renders; only `channelName` rotation tears it down.
